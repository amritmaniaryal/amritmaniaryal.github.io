<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi, my name is Amritmani Aryal (preferred to be called 'Amrit'), and I am a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Miami University.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in Nepal, had my high school education, and completed my undergrad there. I have always been passionate about technology, problem-solving, literature, and sports. My journey into computer science started with a deep interest in understanding how technology can empower individuals and create meaningful solutions to everyday problems.
</p>
<p>
  Before joining Miami University, I gained valuable experience working as a software developer for over two and a half years in software development industry; data engineering to be more specific. During this time, I worked on projects involving financial data analytics, (US) healthcare analytics, web development, and machine learning.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of academics and research, I enjoy travelling, reading, volunteering in the community, exploring new technologies, etc. I have also been involved in volunteering projects; raising cyber awareness, organizing hackathons & coding workshops, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  I value collaboration and mentorship, and I believe in giving back to the community by sharing knowledge and experiences with others. Whether it's through assisting fellow students or contributing to open-source projects, I strive to make a positive impact.
