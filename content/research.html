<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Narrative understanding using Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration with logic programming for structured information extraction.</li>
  <li>Machine learning applications in remote sensing, including deforestation detection and urban expansion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Deforestation Detection Using Remote Sensing</strong>
    <p>
      Leveraging Landsat satellite imagery to detect deforestation patterns in California using machine learning techniques 
      such as Random Forest and K-Means.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exploiting LLMs with Logic Programming for Narrative Understanding</strong>
    <p>
        Exploring how LLMs can extract structured data from natural language stories and feed it into logic programming systems for reasoning 
        and understanding. This project focuses on leveraging Answer Set Programming (ASP) and prompt engineering techniques to interpret scenarios 
        like restaurant activities or daily routines.

<h3>Upcoming Projects</h3>
<p>I've been in touch with my Advisor Dr. Daniela Inclezan about a research project that is about the revitalization of Myamia language. 
    The work has not started yet; I will have to meet a few stakeholders to get a go-ahead for this project. I will post my progress in this page 
    if/when I start working on it</p>

<h3>Publications</h3>
<p>No publications yet, but Iâ€™m actively working on projects that will be submitted for review soon.</p>
